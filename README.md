# Task Implemented
1. Upload data from CSV to PostgreSQL DB
2. Show user's list
3. Design the database schema so that queries to PostgreSQL would not take longer than 250ms
4. Apply filtering based on: User's birth year & month
5. Use redis to cache data for 60 seconds
    1. At first fetch whole data from DB
    2. Then apply pagination on that (custom pagination)
6. Fetch data from DB if it is not available in Redis cache
7. Redis cache will invalid if: Any filter parameter is changed
8. If page is refreshed, then check any filter parameter is used before. If found, use those to call API
9. Pagination limit (how many users will show per page) can be set from front. Default is 20
